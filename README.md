# Cultural Abacus Explorer

## Overview
An interactive educational abacus simulation created for the University of Chicago's Computation Culture and Society class. This project transforms a basic abacus implementation into an engaging, culturally-relevant educational tool.

## Features
- **Multiple Abacus Types**: Japanese Soroban, Chinese Suanpan, and Roman Abacus implementations
- **Cultural Context**: Historical information about each abacus type and its significance
- **Interactive Learning**: Step-by-step tutorial system for beginners
- **Skill Development**: Progressive challenges from basic to advanced operations
- **Visual Customization**: Four unique visual themes (traditional, modern, vintage, neon)
- **Digital Representation**: Real-time conversion between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal
- **Responsive Design**: Works across various devices and screen sizes

## Usage
1. Select an abacus type (Japanese, Chinese, or Roman)
2. Choose a visual theme
3. Try the interactive tutorial to learn basic operations
4. Practice with progressive challenges
5. Explore the relationship between the physical abacus and digital number systems

## Educational Context
This tool demonstrates how computational thinking existed long before electronic computers. The abacus represents one of humanity's earliest computing devices, providing a tangible connection between historical calculation methods and modern computational concepts.
